This is my portfolio page and central repository of all of the projects I have worked on in UCLA's Coding Bootcamp.  As this was the first assignment, it was quite challenging for me!  Adding mobile responsiveness was quite difficult for me as I refused to abandon my original code base after incorporating bootstrap so I had some mysterious sizing challenges.  Overall though, I'm pleased at the layout and especially pleased that all functionality works!
